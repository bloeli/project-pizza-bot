# Pizza Bot

We (Marjaana & Elisa) created a responsive desktopfirst text-based pizza chatbot using Javascript and pair-programming. 

## The problem
 
We started straight away with the week's task from Iteration 1 and so on. 
Googled some and everything went very well and worked until... iteration 6,
that was when the first real problems took place, we discussed, googled some, 
checked the Javascript-code a lot, tested some things and things worked out accept when:

- writing something false (for exampel hamburger) and we got to "Select a pizza from the menu" + ok:
- "Enter the name of the pizza you want to order today:" + hamburger + ok:
- "Select a pizza from menu" + ok:
- "Great, I'll get started on your hamburger right away, it will cost undefined kr. The pizza(s) will take undefined minutes."

also:
- writing something false (for exampel hamburger) and we got to "Select a pizza from the menu" + ok:
- "Enter the name of the pizza you want to order today:" + Pepperoni Pizza + ok:
- "Great, I'll get started on your Pepperoni Pizza right away, it will cost undefined kr. The pizza(s) will take undefined minutes."

(When writing a true orderName straight away it works out calculating the price and the time)

When going further on, also the red levels, we choosed to change the input to a input with dropdown menu instead, 
so that was solving the problem in easy way. 
Then we entered a new problem, that when clicking on the submit-button, the greeting/confirm message just pop up for a second and then
disappear immidately. We asked about about it in Stack Overflow and got answer from a teacher that told about the event attribute
in JS and event.preventDefault();
and this worked out.

Some errors and so on, that we solved by checking in the code and also googled. One problem we have not solved, 
even thoug have googled and tried figure it out, we have'nt solved it. We have now asked the question on Stack Overlflow:
No img should be shown when customer have'nt clicked on submit-button. In our html we have wrote: 
<img id="pizzaImg"src="" alt="Pizza"> and in the Javascript we have one of the pizza images shown when submitted the order. 
So we wonder how to have no picture when not submitted. 
After googling we found a solution to our problem, giving the pizzaImg the attribute display none in when not submitted and when submitted sett to displayed block.
